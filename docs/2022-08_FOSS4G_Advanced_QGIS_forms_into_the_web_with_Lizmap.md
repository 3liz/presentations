# Advanced QGIS forms into the web with Lizmap

Nicolas BOISTEAULT - 3LIZ

<!-- (20s) Hi, I'm going to show you how you can make advanced forms in QGIS which will be easy for users to be filled. This way you'll get more participation and less mistake in your data.
I also will show you that you'll get those forms in the web thanks to Lizmap with no more configuration most of the time. -->

# Organize form's fields

- Use QGIS "Drag and Drop Designer"

![w:800](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/02_QGIS_dnd_tabs_conf.png)

<!-- (20s)
- Decide which fields are to be visible
- Change field's order
- Create tabs and group box
-->

<!-- # Tabs

![w:400 top](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/02_QGIS_dnd_tabs_result.png) ![w:400](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/02_Lizmap_dnd_tabs.png)

# Group box

![w:400 top](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/03_QGIS_dnd_groupbox_result.png) ![w:400](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/03_Lizmap_dnd_groupbox.png) -->

# Toggle tabs or group box visibility on condition

![w:850](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/06_QGIS_toggle_conf.png)

<!-- (35s) Let's say we create a form for everybody (AKA crowdsourcing) but also logged in users in Lizmap (like people in our organization).
Let's say you have a form with many fields but many of them are not mandatory so you don't want to show them all when users open the form to not scare them. If it seems too long to fill it, they might give up and close it.
Here I've created a boolean field called `has_details`, with `Add details` as an Alias to have a more understandable title for this field and it is defined as a `Checkbox`... -->

<!-- (15s) ...I also create a `Details` tab thanks to the `Drag and Drop Designer` configured with a `Control Visibility by Expression` to only display it when `has_details` checkbox is checked. -->

<!-- (10s) Here is the result. As you can see `Details` tab is only visible when `Add details?` is checked -->

# Upload files

- Use "Attachment" widget and "Filter" to define allowed extensions

![w:650](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/04_QGIS_attachment_conf.png)

<!-- (10s) We want people to upload photos. We create fields defined as `Attachment` with a Filter to only display JPEG and PNG files -->

- Edit pictures directly in Lizmap

![w:700](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/04_Lizmap_attachment_crop..gif)

In Lizmap, you can also rotate or crop images. It is more convenient than to have to install a software for that.

# Constraints with expression

![w:500](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/05_Lizmap_constraint.gif)

# Save login and groups

- Expression variables: @lizmap_user for users, @lizmap_user_groups for groups

![w:600](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/07_QGIS_login_conf.png)

<!-- When contributors are logged in Lizmap we can use their user login or user groups in form's expression.
Here I have created an invisible `login` field which get filled by the user login when form is saved
 -->

# Value relation

![w:350](media/foss4g2022_lizmap_advanced_forms/08_Lizmap_value_relation.gif)

# Use case: suggestion based on previous record

- Get last previous record for every users

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (login)
obs.cd_nom, amph.nom_complet, login
FROM foss4g.observations obs
LEFT JOIN foss4g.amphibians_reptiles amph ON obs.cd_nom = amph.cd_nom
ORDER BY login, date_obs DESC
```
